Paraguay 's president wants to resign to start Senate term CNN.com .
ASUNCION Paraguay -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Paraguay 's President Nicanor Duarte offered Congress his resignation Monday two months before his term is slated to end .
Duarte a member of the ruling Colorado Party who was barred by law from running for a second five-year presidential term in last April 's elections instead ran for and won a seat in Paraguay 's Senate .
New senators are to be sworn in on July 1 .
President-elect Fernando Lugo of the Patriotic Alliance for Change is slated to take office on August 15 .
He has supported Duarte 's right to resign .
But other opposition members and even some of Duarte 's own Colorado Party members oppose his bid arguing the constitution does not allow the president to hold another position .
Several others said they would not show up thereby denying him the quorum needed for approval .
They contend the constitution does not allow the president to occupy two offices at the same time a rule intended to ensure the chief of state does not give short shrift to the job .
His resignation offer -- which would require approval from a majority of each house -- is slated for a vote on Tuesday .
I hope that the senators and representatives of the nation can complete their constitutional mandate to reject or accept my resignation Duarte said during a nationally televised address .
He said he wants to continue serving the Paraguayan people from the legislature .
Meanwhile he said he will continue carrying out his duties as president .
