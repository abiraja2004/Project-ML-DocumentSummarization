Ancelotti -- I will not be leaving Milan CNN.com .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti has told Chelsea he will not leave the Serie A club to join the Blues next season .
Chelsea confirmed on Wednesday that Guus Hiddink would manage the side until the end of the season but Ancelotti is reportedly owner Roman Abramovich 's main candidate to replace Luiz Felipe Scolari in the long term .
However AC Milan coach Ancelotti who is under contract until June 2010 told Italian Web site www.calciomercato.com : The only club that has made a move to sign me has been Chelsea .
In the summer I met Abramovich but I did n't want to leave AC Milan .
The same thing happens now I am not thinking about leaving Milan .
Ancelotti 49 is the longest-serving manager in Italy 's top flight after joining the Rossoneri in 2001 -- and it is not the first time he has been linked with a move away from the San Siro .
Even seven years ago this happened Ancelotti added .
At this point of the season the same story comes out but I am not worried .
Ancelotti also spoke about Milan 's loan signing David Beckham .
The England midfielder has impressed since joining in January from Los Angeles Galaxy but is set to leave the club on March 9 unless the Rossoneri agree a deal with the Major League Soccer side .
Ancelotti said : In my opinion in order to keep Beckham sacrifices should be made because he is an important player for the team .
