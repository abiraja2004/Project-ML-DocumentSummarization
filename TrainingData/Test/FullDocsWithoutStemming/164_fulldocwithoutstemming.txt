Thai PM admits boat people pushed out to sea CNN.com .
BANGKOK Thailand -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thailand 's prime minister suspects there were some instances in which Myanmar 's Rohingya boat people were pushed out to sea a frank admittance of a practice drawing worldwide condemnation .
In an exclusive interview with CNN Thursday Abhisit Vejjajiva said he could not pinpoint who in the government approved the practice but said he was working on rectifying the problem .
It 's not exactly clear whose work it is Vejjajiva said .
All the authorities say it 's not their policy but I have reason to believe some instances of this happened but if I can have the evidence as to who exactly did this I will certainly bring them to account .
Thousands of Rohingya refugees -- a Muslim minority group from Myanmar -- have fled to Thailand over the years and many of them have been housed in Thai camps near the Myanmar border .
In some cases there are charges that many of them have been kicked back out to sea from Thailand .
A recent CNN investigation found evidence of the Thai army towing an apparent boatload of 190 Rohingya refugees out to sea prompting Thai authorities to launch an investigation .
And a group of the refugees rescued by Indonesian authorities last week told harrowing tales of being captured beaten and abandoned at sea by the Thai military .
Actress Angelina Jolie a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency spoke out on the plight of the refugees last week as she visited the area with her husband Brad Pitt .
She asked Thailand to permit greater freedom of movement for the roughly 111,000 refugees housed in nine camps along the Thai-Myanmar border .
Vejjajiva said at times there has been a lot of pressure in terms of the numbers of these people coming in .
There are attempts I think to let these people drift to other shores .
I have asked whether people are aware of such practices .
The one thing that is clear is that when these practices do occur it is done on the understanding that there is enough food and water supplied .
The prime minister said he regrets any losses that may have occurred from the refugees ordeals but he said he is doing the best I can to correct the situation .
