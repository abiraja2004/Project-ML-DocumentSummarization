Man dies after cop hits him with Taser 9 times CNN.com .
WINNFIELD Louisiana -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A police officer shocked a handcuffed Baron Scooter Pikes nine times with a Taser after arresting him on a cocaine charge .
He stopped twitching after seven according to a coroner 's report .
Soon afterward Pikes was dead .
Now the officer since fired could end up facing criminal charges in Pikes January death after medical examiners ruled it a homicide .
Dr. Randolph Williams the Winn Parish coroner told CNN the 21-year-old sawmill worker was jolted so many times by the 50,000-volt Taser that he might have been dead before the last two shocks were delivered .
Williams ruled Pikes death a homicide in June after extensive study .
Winn Parish District Attorney Christopher Nevils said he will decide on any charges against the ex-officer Scott Nugent once a Louisiana State Police report on the case is complete .

It 's taken several months for this case to even be properly addressed so one has to wonder why did it take so long ? said Carol Powell Lexing a lawyer for the Pikes family .
Obviously a wrongful death occurred .
Nugent 's lawyer Phillip Terrell said his client followed proper procedure to subdue a man who outweighed him by 100 pounds .
But Williams said Pikes was already handcuffed and on the ground when first hit with the Taser after the 247-pound suspect was slow to follow police orders to get up .
Winnfield a sleepy lumber town about 100 miles southeast of Shreveport Louisiana is best known as the birthplace of legendary Louisiana governors Huey and Earl Long .
It 's also about 45 miles northwest of Jena Louisiana where a racially charged assault case sparked a September 2007 demonstration by an estimated 15,000 people .

One of the teenage defendants in that case Mychal Bell is Pikes first cousin -- and his lawyer was Powell Lexing .
Nugent is white ; Pikes was black .
His death led to demonstrations that drew several dozen people in Winnfield where the population of about 15,000 is roughly half African-American .
The family wants justice Lexing said .
This is just another example of why it 's very important to stay vigilant with these types of cases on the injustice that 's been perpetrated on the disadvantaged .
But Winnfield police Lt. Chuck Curry said race is n't an issue at all in the matter .
This has come down to a police officer that was trying to apprehend a suspect that they had warrants for he said .
He done what he thought he was trained to do to bring that subject into custody .
At some point something happened with his body that caused him to go into cardiac arrest or whatever .
See how Tasers work .
According to police Pikes was wanted on a charge of possession of cocaine when police tried to arrest him outside a shopping center January 12 .
He would not stop for the officer Curry said .
At some point in there he was Tased to bring him under control and several hours later died at the emergency room .
Terrell said Pikes was fighting Nugent on uneven ground amid obstructions such as concrete blocks and barbed wire .
He 's fighting wrestling with an individual who weighs 100 pounds more than him he said .
His partner had just come back to the police department from triple bypass surgery and could not assist Officer Nugent .
Terrell said his client used every means possible to take Pikes into custody before pulling out his Taser a weapon Winnfield police purchased in 2007 .
The only thing he could have done other than to say OK we 're going to let you go is to beat him or Tase him .
He did the right thing Terrell said .
Williams who ruled Pikes death a homicide in June after extensive study said Nugent fired his Taser at Pikes six times in less than three minutes -- shots recorded by a computer chip in the weapon 's handle .
Then officers put Pikes in the back of a cruiser and drove him to their police station -- where Nugent fired a seventh shot directly against Pikes chest .
After he was given that drive stun to the chest he was pulled out of the car onto the concrete Williams told CNN .
He was electroshocked two more times which two officers noted that he had no neuromuscular response to those last two 50,000-volt electroshocks .
Williams said he had two nationally known forensic pathologists including former New York city medical examiner Michael Baden review the case before issuing his conclusions .
He said it 's possible Nugent was shocking a dead man the last two times he pulled the trigger .
This fellow was talking in the back seat of the car prior to shot number seven he said .
From that point on it becomes questionable -LRB- if Pikes was still alive -RRB- .
Curry said Pikes told officers he suffered from asthma and had been using PCP and crack cocaine .
But Williams said he found no sign of drug use in the autopsy and no record of asthma in Pikes medical history .
In the year since Winnfield police received Tasers officers have used them 14 times according to police records -- with 12 of the instances involving black suspects .
Ten of the 14 incidents involved Nugent who has no public disciplinary record .
Nugent was suspended after Pikes death and Winnfield 's City Council voted 3-2 to fire him in May .
He is appealing his dismissal and his lawyer says he followed proper procedures in Pikes case .
He was trained in the use of the Taser by a senior police officer who was present during the incident that led to Pikes death Terrell said .
Curry said Taser International the device 's manufacturer indicates that multiple Tasings do not affect a person .
But he said he could not explain why Pikes was shocked so many times and said whether Nugent followed proper procedure was yet to be determined .
But a copy of the Winnfield Police Department 's Taser training manual obtained by CNN says the device shall only be deployed in circumstances where it is deemed reasonably necessary to control a dangerous or violent subject .
And Williams said regulations regarding the use of Tasers were not followed .
It violated every aspect -- every single aspect -- of the department 's policy about its use the coroner said .
Winnfield has seen a spate of high-profile corruption cases in recent years .
One of Nevils predecessors as district attorney Terry Reeves killed himself amid allegations of embezzlement and extortion .
The town 's current police chief Johnny Ray Carpenter is a convicted drug offender who received a pardon from former Louisiana Gov Edwin Edwards who himself is now serving a federal prison term for racketeering .
And Carpenter 's predecessor Gleason Nugent -- the father of Pikes arresting officer -- committed suicide in 2005 after allegations of fraud and vote buying in the race for police chief an elected position in Winnfield .
Now Nevils is awaiting the state police report on Pikes death which will be presented to a grand jury for possible charges against Nugent -- a possibility Curry said would be a blow to the department .
It 's one of these no-win situations he said .
No matter the outcome nobody 's going to win in this case .
