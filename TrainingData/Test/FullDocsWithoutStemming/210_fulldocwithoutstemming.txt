Return to Tehran a memorable journey CNN.com .
-LRB- Tribune Media Services -RRB- -- In summer I flew from Istanbul 's Ataturk Airport to Tehran 's Khomeini Airport to film a public television show on Iran .
For an American it was eye-opening from the first moment .
When the pilot said We 're taking this plane to Tehran nobody was alarmed .
The wide-body jet was filled with well-off Iranian people .
Although their features were different from mine they dressed and acted just like me .
As so often happens when I travel I was struck by how people are so similar the world over .
I wished the big decision-makers of our world were n't shielded from opportunities to share an economy cabin with people like this .
I had made this same Istanbul-to-Tehran trip 30 years ago .
Last time it took three days on a bus and the Shah was on his last legs .
Wandering Iranian towns in 1978 I remember riot squads in the streets and the Shah 's portrait seeming to hang tenuously in market stalls .
I also remember being struck by the harsh gap between rich and poor in Tehran .
I was 23 years old and confronted with realities that my friends who stayed home were oblivious to .
I believe that was the first time in my life I was angered by economic injustice .
My Istanbul-Tehran trip was much quicker this time -- it took only three hours rather than three days .
Every main square and street that was named Shah back then is now named Khomeini .
In the 1970s all denominations of paper money had one face on them .
They still do today but the face is different .
At Khomeini International Airport the only hint of the Shah were some of the travelers -LRB- many of those flying in were likely his supporters who fled Iran for the West in 1978 and were coming back to visit loved ones -RRB- .
I made a mental note to myself to remember that emigres -LRB- from any country -RRB- I meet and talk with in the USA may have intriguing insights .
But they are a group with something in common -- a reason and the wherewithal to leave their homeland .
As the pilot began our descent into Tehran rich and elegant Persian women put on their scarves .
With all that hair suddenly covered I realized how striking long hair can be -- how it really does grab a man 's attention .
Looking out the window at the lights of Tehran reminded me of flying into Mexico City at night .
Greater Tehran is huge with more people than all of Greece .
A youthful and noisy capital city Tehran is the modern heart of the country .
This smoggy mile-high metropolis with a teeming population of 14 million in the metropolitan area has apartment blocks that stretch far into the surrounding mountains .
My impressions of modern-day Tehran were strong .
There were playful Revolutionary Guards four-lane highways intersecting with no traffic lights Death to America murals and big warm welcoming smiles .
Iran is a fascinating and complex paradox .
I stepped out onto the 15th-floor balcony of my fancy hotel room to hear the hum of the city and to enjoy the view of a vast twinkling city at twilight .
Fresh snow whitened the mountains above the ritzy high-rise condos of North Tehran .
Looking straight down below I saw the hotel 's entryway buzzing with activity .
The hotel was hosting a conference on Islamic unity and the circular driveway was lined by the flags of 30 nations .
Huge collections of flags seemed to be common in Iran -- perhaps because they provided a handy opportunity to exclude the Stars and Stripes .
-LRB- Apart from the ones featured in hateful political murals I had n't seen an American flag -RRB- .
A van with an X-ray security checkpoint was permanently parked outside the entrance .
All visitors entering the hotel needed to pass their bags through the van first .
It was interesting to see that Iran a country we feel we need to protect ourselves from had the same security headaches we do .
Back in my room I nursed a tall glass of pomegranate juice .
My lips puckered from munching lemony pistachios from an elegantly woven tray -- they were the best I 've ever tasted -LRB- and I am a pistachio connoisseur -RRB- .
I cruised the channels on my TV : CNN BBC and lots of programming designed to set the mood for prayer .
One channel showed a mesmerizing river with water washing lovingly over shiny rocks .
Another showed the sun setting on Mecca with its Kaaba -LRB- the big black box focus of pilgrim worship -RRB- in real time .
Lying back on my bed I noticed an arrow on the ceiling -- pointing to Mecca .
I had hardly been outside my hotel and already I realized that visiting a theocracy would be a memorable experience .
-LRB- Rick Steves Iran will air on PBS throughout the USA in mid-January -RRB- .
