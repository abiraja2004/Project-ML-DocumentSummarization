Toddler rock : Paul Field CNN.com .
SYDNEY Australia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This is not just child 's play it 's big business .
The Wiggles are a hit among the toddler set .
But that was n't always their intended audience .
The group initially tried their hands at rock -- under a different name -- in their native Australia .
Eventually with degrees in childhood education Anthony Murray Greg and Jeff swapped rock for rhyme and became icons to the young .
In 17 years they 've sold 17 million DVDs 4 million CDs and continue to play to capacity crowds around the world .
At The Wiggles global HQ on the outskirts of Sydney The Boardroom 's Andrew Stevens asked managing director Paul Field -- an accomplished musician in his own right and brother of Anthony -- what is the secret of their success .
Field : It 's a confluence of reasons really I think it 's um firstly the music is engaging and it 's a huge part of their appeal .
Secondly the guys are also not cast members they are actually the creators of the brand and the show .
And that informs everything they do : the songs the stories their characters .
So the confluence of all those three factors plus an X factor makes them quite unique .
Stevens : Now you 've seen it up close what is it ? .
How do you create the X factor or is it a total mystery ? .
Field : You have to lose your ego when you 're a preschool teacher you know .
Their audience you know our audience is egocentric : There 's only one person in the world and it 's them right ? .
So once you know that you can guide your songs your stories to that .
Stevens : Was there a business plan right from the beginning ? .
Field : There was not a business plan no it was creatively led .
And I think with a lot of things it 's best that way it was organically grown and they wanted to do it 'cause it was fun .
And they had this well in Jeff and Anthony 's case a musical background and an educational background ... Let 's combine them .
And do something unique .
So that 's what drove them in the earliest of days but from fairly early days it engaged they were drawing audiences .
And so the business became quite busy that Anthony and Murray had to make the decisions to leave teaching which was a big decision at the time and go on the road because this business was there .
So in the earliest of days and they did this for five or six years plus their model was we tour which drives the business .
And they toured 10 months of every year right around Australia and they would release one DVD and CD per year .
And that was the model and that pretty much was it and we 've just refined that over the years .
And it was n't really I suppose till the late nineties mid to late nineties once there was interest from the USA when we thought ooh this could actually go beyond our shores .
-LRB- It certainly did not only in the U.S. From Japan to Latin America to Taiwan the Wiggles became a hit -RRB- .
Field : Ok so this is our recording studio and this is where we record all the Wiggles music including overseas versions of Wiggles music so I think we have the Latin American version of Fruit Salad ... and we 've also got a version in Mandarin Fruit Salad .
-LRB- Translating their hits into Spanish and Mandarin has given the Wiggles traction in non-English markets ... while back at home in Australia and in the U.S. they are now chasing the theme-park market -RRB- .
Stevens : Did you ever consider selling out in letting someone like Disney buy the Wiggles lock stock and barrel and walking away with a lot of money and still be able to do the Wiggles without the financial headaches ? .
Field : We have certainly been offered a number of times by different companies major companies over the years .
And the first couple of times it happened it was a bit overwhelming and the guys were saying we really love the way we do this and that was a big part of it .
We do n't know what it means .
And I 'm really glad they made that decision way back over the years because as a company they are worth so much more now .
