At least 10 drug suspects killed in Brazil police raid CNN.com .
RIO DE JANEIRO Brazil -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Police have killed at least 10 drug-trafficking suspects in all-day shootouts in Brazil that closed schools and government offices in three Rio de Janeiro neighborhoods the official news agency said .
The confrontations started Wednesday morning when civil police entered the neighborhoods in search of suspects the state-run Agencia Brasil said .
In the afternoon when civil police were leaving military police moved in and the shootouts started anew .
A woman was wounded and in critical condition the news agency said citing the state 's health minister .
Two schools were closed and 6,600 students were sent home .
Rio de Janeiro police chief Gilberto Ribeiro vowed that the operations will continue but conceded that trafficking will pick back up after the raids end .
You ca n't get discouraged but you ca n't deny that the state is barely drying it up the news agency quoted him as saying .
They need work and are looking for solutions .
People get discouraged and join these criminal gangs .
All this is happening in a context that police are not going to resolve .
Rio has been plagued by a wave of violence that led to protests in December by a group called Rio de Paz .
The group said 9,000 people have been slain and secretly buried since January 2007 .
Many of the deaths come from drug traffickers fighting for territory in Rio 's slums and poor neighborhoods said the group 's president Antonio Carlos Costa .
Others are killed by hit squads and police acting on their own .
In general they are assassinated by police -- police acting outside of their regular work hours Costa said at the time .
They are also assassinated by narco-traffickers .
The bodies are disposed of in secret cemeteries in the metropolitan Rio de Janeiro area or incinerated alive by narco-traffickers in what they call microwaves .
The term refers to pits and ditches where bodies are burned .
