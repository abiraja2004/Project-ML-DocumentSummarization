Hamas says it may consider Israeli soldier 's release CNN.com .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Palestinian militant group Hamas said Monday that it is willing to consider the release of an Israeli soldier who was seized in a cross-border raid more than two years ago .
But the Hamas leadership of Gaza will not release Gilad Shalit as part of a broader cease-fire agreement with Israel according to a statement released Monday from Hamas political official Raafat Naseef .
Hamas is a fundamentalist Palestinian Islamic group whose military wing has attacked Israel .
The United States and Israel consider it a terrorist organization but it also operates a social services network .
Hamas is in control of Gaza after winning parliamentary elections in 2006 and in 2007 a campaign of violence forced the Fatah movement led by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas out of Gaza .
The matter of Shalit was one of three issues that Hamas sought to clarify its commitment to in the statement .
It said the clarifications were in light of recent developments which are concurrent with the Cairo dialogues -- a reference to Egypt 's attempts to broker a larger more detailed cease-fire between Israel and the Hamas leadership of Gaza .
Shalit was 19 when he was captured June 25 2006 by Palestinian militants from Gaza including those from Hamas .
The militants tunneled into Israel and attacked an Israeli army outpost near the Gaza-Israel-Egypt border killing two other soldiers in the assault .
Israel immediately launched a military incursion into Gaza to rescue Shalit but failed .
Outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has been under pressure to secure Shalit 's release as part of a broader cease-fire deal with Hamas .
Israel temporarily halted its recent three-week military operation in Gaza and declared a unilateral cease-fire that did not include Shalit 's release as a condition .
Hamas later declared its own unilateral cease-fire .
Earlier this month Olmert said recent media reports about the negotiations to secure the Shalit 's release were exaggerated and damaging .
Last week Israel held elections for a new government which the centrist Kadima with just one seat more than the right-wing Likud both parties are now seeking to form a ruling coalition .
The strong showing of other right-wing parties -- including Yisrael Beytenu and the Orthodox Shas movement -- means Likud has more natural allies .
Liked leader Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday : We have a government in our hands but we want a broader one .
He added that he will negotiate with other parties including Kadima to form a broad national unity government .
With God 's help I shall head the coming government he said .
I am sure that I can manage to put together a good broad-based and stable government that will be able to deal with the security crisis and the economic crisis .
Netanyahu -- who served as prime minister from 1996 to 1999 -- has supported the expansion of Israeli settlements on the West Bank and has opposed making further territorial concessions in hope of ending the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict .
