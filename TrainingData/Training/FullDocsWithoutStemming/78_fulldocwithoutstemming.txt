Hamilton sets pace in German GP practice CNN.com .
HOCKENHEIM Germany -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Lewis Hamilton dominated Friday 's practice sessions for the German Grand Prix putting McLaren on course for a first Formula One win in Germany in a decade .
Hamilton set the day 's fastest lap at one minute 15.025 seconds in the dry afternoon session at the Hockenheim circuit after having already led the soggy morning session .
Teammate Heikki Kovalainen trailed Hamilton at 1:15.666 .
It was a very strong performance from us and it just showed that we are very competitive and that we did n't have any problems Hamilton said .
It 's going to be close -LRB- with Ferrari -RRB- but I feel strong I feel we can definitely challenge for the front row .
Hamilton was nearly seven-tenths of a second quicker than Ferrari 's Felipe Massa whose 1:15.722 mark led the afternoon session until Hamilton went around fastest with about a minute left .
Tomorrow will be very close within a couple of tenths -LRB- of a second -RRB- Hamilton said .
Kimi Raikkonen was the only other driver to get under the 1:16.00 mark .
The defending world champion ended up with a 1:15.760 for Ferrari .
Teams had to battle the elements which included a gusting wind in the afternoon as the unseasonable weather forced questions over tire strategies for Saturday 's qualifying .
I feel I can claim we will be on the pace in any conditions said Massa who will likely opt for the softer tires .
It wo n't be a stroll in the park but we can take them on .
Mark Webber rounded out the day 's top-five with a best lap of 1:16.017 in his Red Bull .
Rain has hit three of the past four GPs with Hamilton winning two of the races to lead a three-way tie at the top of Formula One 's championship ahead of Massa and Raikkonen .
All three drivers have 48 points two better than Robert Kubica of BMW Sauber .
Weather could play a significant role in Sunday 's race -- again -- with showers expected .
Hamilton oversteered to slide off at one point near the start of the first 90-minute session before pitting as the rain intensified .
The Briton along with most of the field re-emerged with less than 30 minutes remaining and showers subsiding to a drizzle .
The leading time swapped between half a dozen drivers before Hamilton set the pace with his final lap .
I feel good I feel comfortable I feel pretty relaxed said the 23-year-old Hamilton who continues to rebound strongly following last month 's 10th-place finish at the French GP .
I feel much more positive and confident as a driver than I did last year .
Kubica did not get a chance to challenge Hamilton in the opening session after snapping the axel on his front left wheel with 11 minutes left after sliding off .
I touched the white line with the grooved tires the Pole said .
There was some standing water .
I lost control of the car and hit the barrier .
He returned in the afternoon for a best time of 1:16.363 .
Although the course dried up for the afternoon it was still slick -- especially at the Sudkurve corner into the finish line where several drivers ran onto the grass with Timo Glock nearly sending his Toyota airborne .
The sun emerged and the track temperature warmed up -- what Ferrari had been hoping for -- but no driver came close to matching Hamilton who showed his determination to follow up his victory at the British GP with an untouchable last lap .
I do n't think one race gives you momentum it gives you a boost Hamilton said of his 68-second victory at Silverstone .
We had a good race and hopefully we can get a good race this weekend and score some points and then build the momentum .
Though Alonso won the European GP at Nuerburgring last year no McLaren driver has taken the German GP since Mika Hakkinen 's victory 10 years ago .
Ferrari has won five since then with Michael Schumacher the last winner in 2006 .
Meanwhile Honda will stick with current drivers Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello for 2009 team principal Ross Brawn said earlier Friday .
Clearly our priority is to sort the car out because we believe with the drivers we have if we produce a good car then they can produce from their side Brawn said .
So we are not looking at anything major on the driver side -- our main priority is the car .
Button however would not confirm whether he would stick with the team .
I would like to stay on next year because I think it 's a team with a great future Button said .
The 28-year-old Briton would not say if he had signed a deal for 2009 .
Being here next year would be great he said .
Barrichello coming off a third-place finish at the British GP has 11 points to lead the team with Button at three .
Honda is eighth in the constructors standings with 14 points trailing leader Ferrari by 82 .
The car is not as competitive as we obviously want but I see a lot of reasons to be optimistic with the team .
I have seen the team move forward a long way Brawn said .
The 36-year-old Barrichello recently became the most experienced driver in Formula One history .
The former Ferrari and Jordan driver has competed in 257 races .
