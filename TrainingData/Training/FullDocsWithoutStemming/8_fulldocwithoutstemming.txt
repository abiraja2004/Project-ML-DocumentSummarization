Winds hamper rescue of stranded Alaska fishing crew CNN.com .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Coast Guard on Wednesday was trying to reach the stranded four-man crew of an Alaska-based fishing vessel that ran aground in strong winds in the Bering Sea .
The 58-foot Icy Mist is taking on water after running aground off the coast of Alaska 's remote Akutan Island part of the Aleutian Islands according to the Coast Guard .
Hurricane-force winds up to 90 mph -LRB- 145 kph -RRB- are hampering the rescue operation which involves a Coast Guard cutter and a C-130 Hercules aircraft .
The strong winds have delayed the arrival of several helicopters to help rescue the skipper and crew said Petty Officer Walter Shinn a Coast Guard spokesman .
The situation is too dangerous for the C-130 to drop a life raft he explained .
They 're up against the rocky shoreline so it 's really risky right now to drop survival gear Shinn said .
The water could come and wash them away .
The damaged boat is in danger of breaking up according to the Coast Guard which has had intermittent contact with the stranded vessel .
We are n't really certain ... if anyone 's injured Shinn said .
We do n't know .
It is unclear if there was an advisory warning ships to avoid the weather which is severe -- even for the Bering Sea -- according to Shinn .
The ship 's owner Bob Gunderson said he was unaware of the situation but was confident that it was his boat .
He said the skipper and three crew members were fishing for Pacific cod .
The Coast Guard received an initial mayday call from the vessel around 4:40 a.m. Alaska time -LRB- 12:40 a.m ET -RRB- .
