Confessions of a hotel housekeeper CNN.com .
-LRB- Budget Travel -RRB- -- Allison Rupp worked at Yellowstone National Park 's historic Old Faithful Inn in 2004 .
The best guests sleep in .
Three simple letters could inspire the Hallelujah chorus : DND or do not disturb .
One sign hanging on a doorknob and the day 's work was shortened by half an hour .
Two signs ? .
Pure heaven but only if they remained there until my eight-hour shift ended -- otherwise I 'd have to circle back and clean the rooms .
My daily list of 15 rooms -LRB- out of 325 in the hotel -RRB- consisted of DOs -LRB- due out -RRB- and Os -LRB- occupied -RRB- which in housekeeping lingo meant the guests were scheduled to check out or were staying another night .
An occupied room was less labor-intensive -LRB- making the beds rather than changing the sheets saved me 20 minutes -RRB- but there was always the possibility the guest would stay in the room while you worked .
One man watched me clean his entire room from scrubbing the toilet to emptying the trash -- and told me at the end that I was building character .
Condescension is not nearly as encouraging to a maid as a couple of dollars .
As long as it looked clean .
I cut corners everywhere I could .
Instead of vacuuming I found that just picking up the larger crumbs from the carpet would do .
Rather than scrub the tub with hot water sometimes it was just a spray-and-wipe kind of day .
After several weeks on the job I discovered that the staff leader who inspected the rooms could n't tell the difference between a clean sink and one that was simply dry so I would often just run a rag over the wet spots .
But I never skipped changing the sheets .
I would n't sink that low no matter how lazy I was feeling .
A bacterial wonderland .
I was disgusted by the many guests I came in contact with through the things they left behind : the hairs on the pillow the urine on the toilet seat the half-eaten cookie the stained sheets .
One woman had soiled her sheets so thoroughly that we had to toss them in a biohazard bag -- they could never be used again .
Rooms where young kids stayed were the worst with food ground into the carpet and piles of used diapers in the trash .
That kind of demoralizing mess could take 45 minutes to clean up .
Most maids wore rubber gloves when they worked but mine were too big so I discarded them .
Unsurprisingly I got the flu twice .
Not for love -- or money .
I did n't know maids received tips so it took me weeks to realize that the coins left in rooms were an intentional gift .
My tips were paltry : I almost never received more than $ 1 and at times guests left religious pamphlets .
One day however I was shocked to find a crisp $ 100 bill lying on a table .
Although the generous tip put a little spring in my step and compelled me to do a better job that day it did n't change my work ethic for long .
I apologize to you now if you ever stayed in one of my rooms .
You deserved better .
But if housekeepers were paid more than minimum wage -- and the tips were a bit better -- I might have cleaned your toilet rather than just flushed it .
