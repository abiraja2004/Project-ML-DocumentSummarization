FRANKFURT Germany -LRB- AP -RRB- -- German driver Sebastian Vettel will switch to the Red Bull Formula One team from Toro Rosso next season .
Vettel will replace David Coulthard who is retiring at the end of this season .
As he was already part of the Red Bull family choosing Sebastian as Mark Webber 's teammate was not a difficult decision said team chief Sebastian Horner .
Both Toro Rosso and Red Bull are owned by Austrian businessman Dietrich Mateschitz who intends to sell Toro Rosso .
The team will continue racing in 2009 .
Having only turned 21 at the last race and with only 17 Grand Prix starts to his name he is still on a learning curve but it is clear that he has plenty of ability and speed Horner said of Vettel .
Toro Rosso has shown improved form since introducing their new car at Monaco with Vettel finishing in the points in two of the four races since then .
I am very proud to be joining Red Bull Racing and it 's always good to have an early decision on what you are doing next year Vettel said .
The move was announced three days before the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim .
Having got this announcement out of the way I can concentrate on racing for Toro Rosso over the second half of the season Vettel said .
I will try and repay them by doing my very best to get some more good results to add to those we have achieved so far .
