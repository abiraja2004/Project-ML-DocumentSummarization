Strauss century puts England in command CNN.com .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Captain Andrew Strauss struck his 16th Test hundred to put in England in control of their must-win fourth Test against West Indies in Barbados on Thursday .
Strauss and Alastair Cook shared England 's first double-century opening stand for more than four years -- although once their partnership of 229 came to its conclusion minutes after tea the runs dried up .
England totally dominated the first two sessions only to be pegged back by a loss of wickets in a turgid evening period and closed on 301 for three .
Strauss was dismissed for 142 in spectacular manner by fast bowler Daren Powell to provide a breakthrough in the 65th over of a bat-dominated opening day .
A full delivery demolished Strauss stumps to provide Powell with some joy after much suffering .
Opening partner Cook then perished five overs later six short of a hundred when he mis-hit a pull off Jerome Taylor which was clutched by a diving Ryan Hinds at midwicket .
It continued Cook 's run of failing to register a Test century to 27 innings and to add to the frustration this was the 11th time he has got halfway there without converting .
Owais Shah returned to the Test team at Antigua with a half-century but appeared nervous this time around and perished after spending 47 balls over seven when he chopped a delivery from Benn to slip .
The Middlesex batsman contributed to a clogging up of the scoreboard -- only 39 runs were scored in 22 overs between tea and the new ball being taken at 260 for three .
Meanwhile Strauss followed his 169 in Antigua last week by celebrating his latest three-figure contribution before the halfway point of the opening day .
He did so in great style hauling a delivery from spinner Sulieman Benn into the second tier of the Greenidge & Haynes stand .
Strauss took advantage of being dropped on 58 to reach his latest hundred from 144 deliveries -- in addition to that monstrous six he also struck 15 fours .
When play finally finished for the day former captain Kevin Pietersen was unbeaten on 32 and Paul Collingwood was 11 not out .
