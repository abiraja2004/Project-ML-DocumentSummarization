NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- What a joke .
Your Congress has voted to spend almost $ 790 billion of your money on a stimulus package that not a single member of either chamber has read .
The 1,073-page document was n't posted on the government 's Web site until after 10 p.m. the day before the vote to pass it was taken .
I do n't care if you 're Evelyn Wood you ca n't read almost 1,100 pages of the lawyer talk that makes up all legislation in eight or 10 hours .
The criminal part of this boondoggle is divided into two parts .
The first is the Democrats promised to post the bill a full 48 hours before the vote was taken to allow members of the public to see what they were getting for their money .
Both parties voted unanimously to do this ... and they lied .
It did n't happen .
Why am I not surprised ? .
Congress lying to the American people has become part of their job description .
They ca n't be trusted on anything anymore .
I 'm sure part of the reason there was no time for the public to read the bill was the 11th-hour internecine warfare between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
When Reid first announced the compromise had been reached Nancy Pelosi was nowhere to be seen .
And it would take an act of God for this egotistical arrogant woman to miss a photo op where she could take credit for anything .
But she was n't there .
She summoned Reid to her office where unnamed sources said she blew her top over some provision for schools that she was n't happy with .
Pelosi 's snit delayed everything .
It 's really too bad President Obama could n't figure out a way to jettison these two who are poster children for everything that is wrong in Washington .
The Associated Press called the birth of the stimulus bill sausage making in the best tradition of Washington politics as usual .
The second part of the crime is the contents of the bill itself .
Far from being only about jobs infrastructure and tax cuts as promised the stimulus bill stimulates a bunch of other stuff as well .
Eight billion dollars for high-speed rail lines including a proposed line between Las Vegas and Los Angeles .
This little bit of second story work was n't even in the House version of the bill .
iReport.com : So many things to do what would you fix first ? .
It started in the Senate as a $ 2 billion project and came out of the conference committee costing a whopping $ 8 billion .
Gee now who would that benefit ? .
Oh yeah the Senate majority leader is from Nevada .
Filipino veterans most of whom do n't live in the U.S. will get $ 200 million in compensation for World War II injuries .
And : $ 2 billion in grants and loans for battery companies $ 100 million for small shipyards and a rollback of the alternative minimum tax at a cost of some $ 70 billion .
The AMT provision is much-needed legislation but it does n't belong in the stimulus bill .
It forced other things out so Congress could keep to its self-imposed $ 800 billion cap .
And when it comes to the tax cuts contained in the stimulus bill experts have determined they will amount to about $ 13 per week after taxes for the average American .
I 'm not sure how much stimulation $ 13 a week buys .
It depends on the neighborhood .
The biggest problem of all is the stimulus bill may not be nearly enough .
And if the president has to come back asking for more the next time might not be so easy .
So far we have an anemic stimulus bill and some sort of vague proposal from the secretary of the Treasury to deal with the banking crisis -- a proposal that landed with a thud last week -- as the two first steps toward solving a financial crisis that is threatening to take down the country .
Obama better step up his game or it 's going to be a short four years in office .
