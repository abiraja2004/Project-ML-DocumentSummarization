Gay diagnosed with leg muscle injury CNN.com .
EUGENE Oregon -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Sprinter Tyson Gay has a mild strain in a muscle in the back of his leg and has been told to restrict himself to light physical activity for the next two weeks .
Gay pulled up abruptly in the first 40 meters of his 200-meter qualifying race on Saturday at the U.S. Olympic trials and had to be carted off the track .
He was diagnosed with a severe cramp in his hamstring and an MRI that afternoon revealed the extent of the strain .
A statement from his representatives said : Tyson is expected to engage in active rest for up to 12-14 days with light physical activity increasing through that period -- then resume training .
Gay revealed : Before I went out on the track I felt a little tightness in my hamstring .
So I had kind of a bad feeling .
When I came off the curve the first two steps were fine and then I felt it sort of a pull about 40 meters in .
Once I was on the ground it did n't hurt as much as when it happened .
It 's just one of those things .
The only race Gay is signed up for before the Olympics is the 100 meters at the London Grand Prix on July 24-25 at Crystal Palace .
Gay the defending world champion in both the 100m and 200m had already qualified for the Olympic 100 meters .
That competition begins on August 15 in Beijing .
If he can run he would also be expected to be part of the 400-meter relay team .
But his chance for a medal in the 200m is now gone because of the injury .
USA Track and Field rules state that only the top three finishers in an event qualify for the Olympics regardless of an athlete 's past record or any injuries .
