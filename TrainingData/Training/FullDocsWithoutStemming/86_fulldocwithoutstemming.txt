UK public sector workers strike over pay CNN.com .
LONDON England -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Thousands of British local government employees began a two-day strike over pay on Wednesday .
Unions said they expected more than half a million workers in England Wales and Northern Ireland to join the walkout that began at a minute past midnight -LRB- 2301GMT Tuesday -RRB- closing museums libraries civic offices and some schools .
The workers are members of public sector unions and include library staff garbage collectors and school support staff .
Union members have rejected the offer of a 2.45-percent pay increase saying it is far below the rate of inflation .
They want a 6-percent raise .
Official figures released this week put Britain 's main inflation measure at 3.8 percent in June amid rising costs for gasoline and staple foods .
Local government employers say any pay increase above 2.45 percent would have to be funded through higher taxes and service cuts .
The unions disagree and say their mostly low-paid members are taking a real-terms pay cut .
The growing gap between wages and inflation is the reason why thousands of council workers will reluctantly be going on strike said Brendan Barber general secretary of union federation the Trades Union Congress .
Britain has seen a growing number of strikes as Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's government attempts to dampen down public-sector salaries and spending to keep a lid on inflation .
