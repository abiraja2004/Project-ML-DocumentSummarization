For months North Korea has been dismantling other parts of the facility under the the watchful eyes of representatives of the six nations that have been involved in the talks .
On June 26 North Korean officials turned over a 60-page declaration to China written in English that details several rounds of plutonium production at the Yongbyon plant dating back to 1986 .
In it North Korea acknowledged producing roughly 40 kilograms of enriched plutonium -- enough for about seven nuclear bombs according to the U.S. State Department .
In response U.S. President George W. Bush said he would lift some U.S. sanctions against North Korea and remove the country from the State Department 's list of state sponsors of terrorism .
But he made clear that other sanctions remain in place on North Korea -- which has been on the list since its alleged involvement in the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner that killed 115 people .

South Korea said Thursday it would ask Japan to join other regional countries in providing aid to the North .
North Korea agreed to abandon its atomic weapons program on a promise from the other five nations in the talks that they deliver energy aid equivalent to one million tons of heavy fuel oil .

Tokyo is awaiting the results before deciding whether to provide the aid .
