-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The recently appointed senator from Illinois Roland Burris asked us to look beyond the Blagojevich scandal and judge him independently .
Many people did .
Turns out we probably should n't have .
Burris you 'll recall was impeached Gov Rod Blagojevich 's gift to the people of Illinois .
One of Blagojevich 's final acts before he was thrown out of office was choosing Burris to take Barack Obama 's U.S. Senate seat .
Plenty of people cried foul at the time arguing Burris should not be seated .
But Democratic senators gave him the benefit of the doubt and welcomed him to the club .
Turns out they probably should n't have .
Watch Campbell Brown discuss Roland Burris .
Burris who initially said he never tried to raise money for Blagojevich while lobbying for the Senate seat now has admitted that he did try to raise money for Blagojevich at the request of the governor 's brother .
He says the only reason he did n't tell us that is because we did n't ask .
Turns out that 's not exactly true either ... he was asked a number of times and dodged the questions .
Republicans are already calling for his resignation and Politico.com is reporting the Senate Ethics Committee will likely launch an investigation .
Burris still claims he 's done nothing wrong and says he welcomes the investigation .
iReport.com : Should Burris be investigated ? .
But any of us who give him the benefit of the doubt this time around ought to know better .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Campbell Brown .
