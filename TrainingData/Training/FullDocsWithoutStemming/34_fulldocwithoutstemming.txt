Sprint king Cavendish claims fourth Tour win CNN.com .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- British sprint sensation Mark Cavendish claimed his fourth stage victory at the drug-tainted Tour de France on Friday as he snatched the 13th leg from Narbonne to Nimes .
Cavendish became only the second British cyclist to win back-to-back stages in the prestigious event as he sneaked past veteran Australian Robbie McEwen in the 182-kilometer -LRB- 113.1-mile -RRB- trek clocking four hours 25 minutes 42 seconds .
He is only the second sprinter in the last 10 years to win four stages in the same Tour de France the other being Alessandro Petacchi in 2003 .
McEwen 's compatriot Cadel Evans retained the overall lead after finishing alongside his closest rivals in the main peloton .
He holds a one-second lead over Frank Schleck of Luxembourg and is 38 seconds ahead of U.S. rider Christian Vande Velde in third .
Cavendish 's victory came after the Saunier Duval team fired Italian rider Riccardo Ricco winner of the sixth and ninth stages and his compatriot Leonardo Piepoli .
Ricco was removed from the race Thursday after testing positive for an advanced version of banned blood booster EPO .
Piepoli did not test positive but the team said he breached its code of ethics .
Despite his heroics Cavendish lies well off the pace in the overall standings .
The Columbia team rider was left 144th out of 158 competitors -- one hour and 52 minutes behind Evans .
The 23-year-old told BBC Radio 5 Live : I only planned to do 10 days of the Giro de Paris but finished it and now I 'm 13 days into the Tour not feeling too tired I 'll take every day as it comes and see how far I can get .
However Cavendish -- who comes from the Isle of Man -- was unsure if he would will stay in the Tour through the Alps in order to challenge for a fifth win on the Champs-Elysees or whether he would withdraw to prepare for the Beijing Olympics .
He still trails green jersey points leader Oscar Freire of the Rabobank team by 28 points lying second equal with Credit Agricole 's Thor Hushovd .
It was a real battle out there but somehow I 'm still no closer to the green jersey Cavendish added on Eurosport .
I do n't know what I have to do ! .
It just proves that you have to be ultra-consistent to win the points competition .
I was tired but ever since I was 13 I 've shown that if there 's a win up for grabs I forget everything and motor .
Again the lead-out was perfect the real hard work was done for me .
The conditions were supposed to be kind but when we reached Nimes there was a real block headwind .
It did n't feel like my most comfortable win .
