1) "train.py" can be used for learning a model.
It expects the training documents to be at "./training/FullDocs/" and their corresponding small summaries to be at "./training/SmallSumms/" (similarly their corresponding large summaries at "./training/LargeSumms/"), and their corresponding vector files at "./vectors/".
The number of training documents is to be given as the command line argument while executing "train.py".
It generates two files train_set.csv and mined_data.txt out of which mined_data.txt has the information about the learned model (each line containing the metrics of each of the features for a particular class) and train_set.csv is generated as an intermediate file that will be used by itself.

2) "giveSummary.py" can be used for generating the summaries.
It expects "mined_data.txt" file to be in the same directory as this.
The path to the input document and its corresponding vector file are to be given as command line arguments while executing "giveSummary.py"
It generates a large summary and a small summary.
